			<h3>A well deserved love, <br> <br> 
            Dear, love. <br> <br> </h3>
            <h4>I'm writing you this brief note to let you know how much our relation means to me.
                As you can see, our romance offically began at the precise same time that I was going through
            a difficult period in my life. </h4> <br>
            <h4>You were like a balm to me at the time, taking away all of my headaches. The Support you've been giving me has been very Important to me, so it's meaningful. The Relief Manifested in a Comprehensive, Patient, and Careful Person. I'm expressing my complete enthusiasm here since, up until now, you have been kind and wonderful. I feel as like the emptiness I was experiencing has been supplied by your Presence, and I am grateful to God for that. Although our relation is still young and we don't know if it will endure forever, the truth is that I really like you! Though not very valuable in and of itself, this admiration gives me the greatest grounds for optimism that I will soon enter a new and happy era of my life. Since we didn't have many happy times in our lives, we now long for a better future for ourselves. I hope that our coming together has brought about the completion of our existences. I believe we merit it.</h4>
